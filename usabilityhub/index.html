			<div><h1>Your user research Swiss Army knife.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>I joined the UsabilityHub team - a remote user research platform - in early 2017 as their first design hire to help them redesign the whole platform which is used by industry giants like Google, Amazon, Asana, and many more.</p>

				<p>My biggest challenge was creating a refined experience, keeping every step simple &amp; straightforward for new users while meeting the expectations of experienced users.</p>

				<p>The best part of all that is, I was able to use the very tool I'm redesigning to test the new interfaces along the way.</p>

			<div><h1>An intuitive experience.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>Thanks to unlimited usability testing, I was able to take the guesswork out of design decisions and create a rock-solid foundation for an "almost invisible" interface.</p>

				<p>Analytics reports and customer feedback clearly pointed out that we nailed creating an intuitive experience. Even first-time users was able to create &amp; run tests and start collecting results within minutes and experienced users were happy to have new &amp; more advanced features. Voila!</p>

				<p>I still use UsabilityHub frequently along with thousands of people who are working hard to make the <span style="text-decoration: line-through; opacity: 0.5;">web</span> world a better place.</p>
