				<p>I was a part of Atolye15 - a close-knit team of designers &amp; developers - for 4 years, leading the design team and crafting digital products for founders &amp; companies from a variety of industries.</p>

				<p>The challenge harder than shipping various projects was evolving Atolye15 from a local player into a world-class company.</p>

				<p>I've taken part in strategic decision for high-budget projects, presented to stakeholders, talked in events and took responsibility in terms of outcomes.</p>

			<div><h1>An intuitive experience.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>Thanks to unlimited usability testing, I was able to take the guesswork out of design decisions and create a rock-solid foundation for an "almost invisible" interface.</p>

				<p>Analytics reports and customer feedback clearly pointed out that we nailed creating an intuitive experience. Even first-time users was able to create &amp; run tests and start collecting results within minutes. Voila!</p>

				<p>I still use UsabilityHub frequently along with thousands of users who are working hard to make the <span style="text-decoration: line-through; opacity: 0.5;">web</span> world a better place.</p>
