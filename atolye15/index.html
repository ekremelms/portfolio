			<div><h1>Evolution of a company.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>I was a part of Atolye15 - a close-knit team of designers &amp; developers - for 4 years, leading the design team and crafting digital products for founders &amp; companies from a variety of industries.</p>

				<p>The challenge harder than shipping various projects was the process of transforming Atolye15 from a local player into a world-class design &amp; development partner.</p>

				<p>I've taken part in strategic decisions for high-budget projects, presented to stakeholders, talked in events and took responsibility in terms of outcomes.</p>

				<p>The transformation of Atolye15, not only in terms of visual style but also culture was once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

				<p>With the right strategic decisions and a look &amp; feel to amplify them, the company became a love-mark amongst gifted professionals and also grabbed the attention of potential customers which led to working on bigger projects with higher budgets.</p>

				<p>I've always felt proud to be an alumni of <a href="https://www.atolye15.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link"> Atolye15</a> where I leveled up as a professional.</p>
