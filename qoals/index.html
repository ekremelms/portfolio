			<div>
				<p>Qoals is one of my side projects which started with a personal need: a simple &amp; straightforward goal-based project management tool, then turned into something worth investing more time.</p>

				<p>In a world bloated by productivity tools, I wanted to see if there is any demand for yet another project management tool first. I bought a domain, put together a landing page and submitted it to producthunt, betalist and some landing page galleries to see one simple thing: will people sign up for a free beta? I used fake door testing and redirected the users who wanted to sign-up to a typeform, asking them some questions like the size of their team, the feature set they are hoping for, etc.</p>

				<p>The results were better than I expected, I got over 3000 visitors in a few days and over 10% conversion rate without spending a cent!</p>

			<div><h1>Build, test, learn, rinse &amp; repeat.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>The "test early, test often" approach really worked and I decided to give it a shot after seeing the potential of the idea.</p>

				<p>I'm spending my spare time to build qoals for the last few months with a team of freelancers. It's a good experiment to keep my decision-making skills sharp and a blank canvas to test ideas as a solo founder. Frankly, I don't care if it will dominate the market (it probably won't) or make thousands of $$$, I'd be happy if I learn something from building it and it solves problems of other people along with me.</p>

				<p>You can join the free beta on <a href="https://qoals.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link">qoals</a> and experience it for yourself.</p>
