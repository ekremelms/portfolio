			<div><h1>Democratizing technology for short-term rental hosts.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>I joined smartbnb - a fully distributed team, building the future of short-term rental industry - in 2018 as a product designer to lead the visual direction and improve the user experience of the platform that's heavily used by short-term rental hosts worldwide.</p>

				<p>After spending my first 6 months improving the legacy version and learning more about the userbase &amp; industry, I dived deep into building a new, consistent and sustainable interface which allowed us not only fix the known usability problems but also leaving enough room for new features yet to come.</p>

				<p>I took on the web &amp; mobile app, visual design and branding as a one-man-design-team, working closely with the CEO, engineering and CS team.</p>

			<div><h1>The cool kid of the industry.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>After nine months of long meetings, wonderful discussions and huge amounts of coffee (and wine), smartbnb v.2 was launched in autumn 2019.</p>

				<p>The hard work we've put in the complete overhaul of the platform which is used daily by thousands of hosts has paid off not only in appraisal from the hosts but also a significant jump in the MRR and NPS scores.</p>

				<p>I'm still a part of the smartbnb team, constantly pushing the platform forward and improving it to better suit customer needs.</p>
