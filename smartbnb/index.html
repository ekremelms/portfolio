			<div>
				<p>I joined smartbnb - an automation tool for short-term rental industry - in late 2018 as a product designer to lead the visual direction of the new web app that'll be heavily used by short-term rental hosts worldwide.</p>

				<p>After spending 6 months improving the current version and learning more about the user behaviour, I dived deep into building a new, more consistent and sustainable app design which allowed us not only fix the current usability problems but also leaving enough space for new features to come.</p>

				<p>Our goal was to create a "magical experience" for hosts, proactive in terms of displaying items and more organized information architecture with updated navigation, a new filtering system and a reactive sections that "unfolds" as the user dives into details.</p>
