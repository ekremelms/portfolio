			<div><h1>Democratizing technology for short-term rental hosts.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>I joined smartbnb - a fully distributed team, building the future of short-term rental industry - in late 2018 as a product designer to lead the visual direction and improve the user experience of the web app that's heavily used by short-term rental hosts worldwide.</p>

				<p>After spending my first 6 months improving the current version and learning more about the userbase, I dived deep into building a new, more consistent and sustainable interface which allowed us not only fix the known usability problems but also leaving enough wiggle room for new features to come.</p>

				<p>I took on the new branding and marketing website in addition to web and mobile app.</p>

			<div><h1>The cool kid of the industry.</h1></div>
			<div>
				<p>After nine months of long meetings, wonderful discussions and huge amounts of coffee, we launched smartbnb v.2 in autumn 2019.</p>

				<p>The hard work we've put in the complete overhaul of a platform that is used daily by thousands of hosts has paid off not only in appraisal but also a significant jump in the MRR and NPS scores.</p>

				<p>Working as a one-man-design-team in this project was both satisfying in terms of outcome and also one of the highlights of my life. 10/10 would do it again!</p>
